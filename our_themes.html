		<p>You are very dependent on the opinions of other people.  1.  The law of demand and the law of supply operate here.  Some people find empathic listening is too time-consuming.  Another type of capital, including raw materials, materials, energy resources, is completely consumed in one production cycle, being embodied in the manufactured product.  You listen to understand.  (Let me think if this is what I really mean?) - Well ...  But in practice, especially in modern conditions, such power is ineffective.  If you, being prepared to see a young woman, saw her in the combined picture (this happens in 90% of cases), then you would undoubtedly find it difficult to think about helping her cross the road.  The half-year program was thus reduced to five weeks and delivered significantly better results. </p>

		<p>- Dad, don't worry! After all, it is not at all necessary to arrange these joint walks every time! - Then she fell silent and, after a pause, said: - Do you know why you don't like Star Wars? Because you don’t understand the philosophy and meaning of the training of the Jedi Knights.  And if our actions are governed by our feelings, this means that we, having relieved ourselves of responsibility, allowed them to do it.  - Yes, it was great - somersaults, doing all sorts of things in the air! Truth? Having received no answer, I suddenly realized that I was the only one holding the conversation.  But we have very good plans to improve management, reduce costs and increase our market share.  The late JK Penny [24] is credited with admitting that the wisest decision he ever made was to “let go” when he realized he could no longer do it alone.  These are standards, or principles, or unwritten criteria that continually guide the decision-making process and your actions.  Some of the identified markets are also heterogeneous and have their own structure.  2).  You can also be a very busy person without being very efficient.  In addition, you help him sort out his own thoughts and feelings.As his confidence grows in your genuine desire to listen and understand, the barrier between what's going on inside him and what he's telling you collapses. </p>

		<p>The lifestyle of thosewho spends time almost exclusively in Squares III and IV may be called irresponsible.  You are able to evade the perception of negative energy.  For example, he pays the same price for each egg or each glass of water.  In addition, taking into account the interests of other people is required in order to avoid that crisis atmosphere,which often accompanies this kind of meeting.  Some people think that “proactive” is a brash, aggressive and unfeeling person, but this is not at all the case.  Demand is determined by the solvent need of buyers (consumers), and supply is determined by the totality of goods offered by sellers (manufacturers).  But it was inconvenient to refuse, and as a result, she accepted the offer.  Therefore, I try to make promises very carefully and sparingly, taking into account all possible circumstances that may suddenly prevent me from fulfilling them.  21.
